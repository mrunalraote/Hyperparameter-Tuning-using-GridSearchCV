# Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV

## Objective
To optimize machine learning model performance by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Dataset (sklearn)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset
2. Split into training and testing sets
3. Scaled features
4. Trained default SVM model
5. Applied GridSearchCV for tuning
6. Compared performance

## Results
GridSearchCV successfully improved model accuracy compared to default parameters.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
