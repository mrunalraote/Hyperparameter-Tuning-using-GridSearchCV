# Hyperparameter-Tuning-using-GridSearchCV
This task demonstrates hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV on the Breast Cancer dataset. An SVM model is trained with default settings and then optimized by testing different parameter combinations. The tuned model is evaluated and compared with the baseline to show performance improvement.
